# ZAKA + ARCDEX

> Built with Arc Studio - money-powered apps in minutes

Two apps in this repo:
- **ZAKA** — USDC mobile wallet for African markets (send, receive, withdraw to mobile money)
- **ARCDEX** — DexScreener-style DEX terminal for Arc mainnet (token terminal, swap, portfolio)

## Deployed Contracts

### ArcDexRouter
- **Arc Testnet:** `0xefa4f596da0c2acfcba47b43389be26e96912516`
  - Explorer: https://explorer.testnet.arc.io/address/0xefa4f596da0c2acfcba47b43389be26e96912516
  - TX: `0x0e8f992af5eb26fd5a0e6ca49480381c78f24aac38435bd51f9041b5045c7198`
- **Arc Mainnet:** deploy using `scripts/deploy-mainnet.sh` with your own wallet — bytecode is in `contracts/out/ArcDexRouter.sol/ArcDexRouter.json`
  - Constructor args: `(0x68b3465833fb72A70ecDF485E0e4C7bD8665Fc45, 0x274262A0321A0701b0A46a3576e07aE881c286Bb, YOUR_OWNER_WALLET)`

### ArcLaunchpad
Self-contained bonding-curve launchpad — no separate LaunchToken deploy needed, `createToken()` deploys each token itself. See `contracts/ArcLaunchpad.sol` for full design notes (why graduation doesn't migrate to an external Uniswap pool, why anti-snipe/anti-bundle are USDC-denominated not token-%-based).
- **Status: LIVE on Arc mainnet.** 28/28 tests passing (incl. 10,000-run fuzz on `testFuzz_buySellNeverBreaksInvariants`) via `forge test --match-contract ArcLaunchpadTest`, deployed and verified on-chain (state read back and cross-checked against expected values post-deploy).
  - **Address:** `0xEf6a8fdaF0181E19CC2C7575ada4b9c279809a67`
  - Explorer: https://explorer.arc.io/address/0xEf6a8fdaF0181E19CC2C7575ada4b9c279809a67
  - Owner: the deployer wallet (`0x414B6Be4CF906739FbF7D49165beCa5F4CeEC3dA`) — dedicated deploy-only wallet, not the project's main wallet
  - `platformFeeWallet`: `0x274262A0321A0701b0A46a3576e07aE881c286Bb` (same wallet as `ArcDexRouter`'s fees, per the default)
  - `VITE_ARC_LAUNCHPAD_ADDRESS` is set in Vercel production and `.env`
- **Redeploy / reference:** `scripts/deploy-launchpad.sh` — bytecode is in `contracts/out/ArcLaunchpad.sol/ArcLaunchpad.json`. Defaults `PLATFORM_FEE_WALLET` to `0x274262A0321A0701b0A46a3576e07aE881c286Bb` — override the env var if you ever want fees going elsewhere.
  - Constructor args used: `(0x414B6Be4CF906739FbF7D49165beCa5F4CeEC3dA, 0x274262A0321A0701b0A46a3576e07aE881c286Bb)`
- **Fees — two additive layers, paid directly out of every trade, no accrual:**
  - 5% of each token's 1B supply → `platformFeeWallet` at creation (95% seeds the curve). No flat USDC creation fee.
  - Platform swap fee: fixed 1%, always, 100% to `platformFeeWallet`.
  - Creator tax: 0-3%, the creator's choice, fixed forever once launched — 60% straight to the creator's wallet, 40% to `platformFeeWallet`.
  - Worst case total per trade: 4%.
- **Buyback-and-burn is manual and off-contract, by design** — there is no on-chain treasury. To buy back the platform's own token: launch it through the UI like any other token, then from `platformFeeWallet` call `buy()` on ArcLaunchpad, then call `burn(amount)` on the token itself (`LaunchToken` is `ERC20Burnable`).
- **Anti-rug / anti-bot, all enforced on-chain:**
  - Anti-snipe: buys capped at $2,000/tx for the first 10 minutes after launch (`SNIPE_MAX_BUY_USDC`, `SNIPE_WINDOW_SECONDS`).
  - Anti-bundle: total buys capped at $5,000/block across ALL wallets (`MAX_USDC_PER_BLOCK`) — this is what actually stops multi-wallet bundlers, since per-wallet caps alone don't.
  - Anti-bot: `buy`/`sell`/`createToken` require `msg.sender == tx.origin`, blocking any contract-mediated call. This stops contract-based sniper/wash-trading bots specifically — it cannot stop a human wash-trading by hand across several of their own real wallets, and the contract's own doc comment says so rather than overclaiming.
  - No emergency-withdrawal function of any kind — real reserves have no path out except a user's own `sell`.
- $25,000 real-USDC graduation threshold — a status flag only; the same curve prices every trade before and after it, so there's no migration step and no price discontinuity.
- Once the platform's own token is launched through the UI and burns have started, set `VITE_ARC_PLATFORM_TOKEN_ADDRESS` to power the burn ticker.

### ArcDexRouter swap fees — already live
`ArcDexRouter.sol`'s `_collectFeeAndPrepareSwap` takes `feeBps` (1%, owner-adjustable but hard-capped on-chain at `MAX_FEE_BPS=100`) off every swap and sends it straight to `feeWallet`, set to `platformFeeWallet` at deploy. No code change was needed for this — it was already correct.

### Bridge fees — `src/arcdex/lib/bridgeKit.ts`
Circle's Bridge Kit has a native mechanism for this (`kit.setCustomFeePolicy`), used instead of a hand-rolled side-transfer. `computeBridgeFee()`: 0.5% of the transfer, bounded to [$0.05, $50]. Bridge Kit adds this **on top of** the transfer amount (wallet debits `amount + fee`, shown in `Bridge.tsx` before signing) and auto-splits it 10% to Circle / 90% to `PLATFORM_FEE_WALLET` — that 10/90 split is Circle's own mechanic on `CustomFeePolicy`, not something this app controls. Only applies to USDC (Bridge Kit rejects a custom fee policy on non-USDC tokens), which is all this app bridges.
